# NovaTurientTraveller
The objective of the project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of a travel and trekking company. 
Administrator Module, Travel Module, Routes Module, Booking Module, and Testimonials Module. 
The proposed system is a website and maintains a centralized repository of all  related information. 
The system allows one to easily access the relevant information and make necessary travel arrangements. 
Users can decide about places they want to visit and make bookings online for travel and accommodation.
